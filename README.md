# The Infinity Display

## Overview

An infinity mirror is an optical illusion created by two parallel mirrors reflecting light between each other. This can be typically found in restrooms. Infinity mirrors is a common project for DIY hobbyists and was my first project as a college student.

A LED matrix is an array of lights similar to a TV, but with a low pixel density. Like a TV, we are able to map images and animations to the display. This is also very popular with hobbyist, but never pursued on the large scale because of the cost.

The Infinity Display is a combination of these two subjects. The parallel mirrors lay on the frame with a LED display as a back light. The light from the LEDs become trapped between the mirrors and create the tunneling optical illusion of an infinity mirror.

As an engineer creating these systems come easy, but it is only have the battle. The display will only work if it has software to back it up! The goal of this repository is to create a simple UI to give my creation an interactive touch to multiple participants.

The party is just getting started!
