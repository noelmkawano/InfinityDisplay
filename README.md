# The Infinity Display

<img src="infdis.jpg" width="500px"/>

## Overview

This is a web application that collects parameter values for a LED display.

The current version will ask a user for four values:

  * Equalizer opacity
  * Wave form opacity
  * Sound reactive sensitivity
  * Trail effect intensity

These values are then packaged into a text file that is then read by the device driving the LEDs.

To use this, the user must have both intelliJ and Processing installed.

A physical LED display is not required to develop code for this project.

Animations are simulated using a Processing GUI.

## Features

The Infinity Display provides the following features:


ics-play-bootstrap provides the following features:

  * Modifications to the "play-java" Activator template to eliminate checkstyle errors.

  * Rename view files to be capitalized (i.e. Index.scala.html, not index.scala.html). This is so that the Java class generated by these templates are capitalized, conforming to standard Java practice.

  * Modifications to [Main.scala.html](https://github.com/ics613s15/ics-play-bootstrap/blob/master/app/views/Main.scala.html) template to load [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) files using CDN sites.

  * Modifications to illustrate simple page navigation through changes to the [controller](https://github.com/ics613s15/ics-play-bootstrap/blob/master/app/controllers/Application.java), [routes](https://github.com/ics613s15/ics-play-bootstrap/blob/master/conf/routes), and [view](https://github.com/ics613s15/ics-play-bootstrap/tree/master/app/views) files.

  * The [navbar](https://github.com/ics613s15/ics-play-bootstrap/blob/master/app/views/Main.scala.html) highlights the current active page through a parameter passed from the controller.

  * The [main.css](https://github.com/ics613s15/ics-play-bootstrap/blob/master/public/stylesheets/main.css) adjusts body padding due to the use of the fixed-top navbar.

  * Support for simple [tests](https://github.com/ics613s15/ics-play-bootstrap/blob/master/test/test/IntegrationTest.java).
